I have developed this blog website using Html and Css for my classmate for his marketing business.He does the business of printing the shirts and he wanted a website to reach out his customers.
This website helps to give the design samples of his T-shirt brand having name as Offbeats!Interested customers can check out the designs and in turn can reach out to him for the order 
through his Instagram id given in the footer of the website.This website is made up of the T-shirts and its blogs.Website is accessible over the internet.So anybody can open it from anywhere.
This is the speciality of this website.This website has its SSL certification also.This website run over the internet using the subdomain kesug.com.
